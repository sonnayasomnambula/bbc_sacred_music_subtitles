1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,120
# Hail, gladdening light

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,200
# Hail, gladdening light

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:17,280
# Of His pure glory poured

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,880
# Who is th'immortal... #

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,480
This is the church that my parents
attended when I was growing up.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,280
Members of my family have been
baptised, married and buried here.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,120
For our services, we drew on the
rich tradition of Anglican hymns

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,440
following the biblical exhortation
that we should lift up our hearts
and sing.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,920
In the details of the story of
Western church music are to be found
insights into the human condition

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,960
and into our relationship with God.

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,880
MUSIC: "Requiem Opus 48"
by Faure

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,160
My schooldays were spent
as a chorister here
at St Paul's Cathedral.

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,440
The beginning of a lifelong passion
for choral singing.

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,600
# ..Dona eis requiem... #

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,640
In this series,
with Harry Christophers
and his choir, The Sixteen,

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,720
we'd like to take a journey
through the last 150 years,

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,000
looking at some
of the great composers who shaped
the world of sacred music.

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,320
Over the next four episodes,

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,680
I'll be travelling across Europe
from Germany and the music
of Brahms and Bruckner

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,040
to the intensely personal voices
of Faure and Poulenc in France.

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,640
MUSIC: "Kanon Pokajanen"
by Arvo Part

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,800
In Eastern Europe, I'll be looking
at the music of Part and Gorecki

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,040
and the role of sacred music
as communism crumbled and
the Iron Curtain was swept away.

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,400
In the fourth and final programme,

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,440
I will be searching out the links
between music and spirituality
in 21st-century Britain.

26
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,480
But, our story begins in
19th-century Germany and Austria

27
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,880
with the music of Brahms and
Bruckner,

28
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:08,160
two giant pillars
of the great Germanic tradition
and musical descendants of JS Bach.

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,560
They were composers of great
conviction, makers of music
both sacred and secular.

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,080
But two men who could not have
been more different.

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,720
# Ecce sacerdos, magnus... #

32
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,640
Anton Bruckner, born in the secure
heartland of a declining
Austrian Empire,

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,840
was a devout Catholic
all his life and his music is a
confident affirmation of his faith.

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,880
And, Johannes Brahms,
a north German Protestant.

35
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,480
He confidently addressed
questions of faith, death,
and human existence.

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,520
But, ultimately, found himself
unable to believe in anything
but his music.

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:03:00,680
# Mit Fried und Freud
ich fahr dahin

38
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:09,960
# In Gottes Willen... #

39
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,440
By the end of his life, Johannes
Brahms had secured his reputation

40
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,040
as a great composer
and a master of the symphony.

41
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,640
But his early career
was launched by his less well known
sacred choral music.

42
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,040
Work that is deeply personal,
profoundly human,
and distinctly German.

43
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,720
So, I've travelled to his hometown
of Hamburg,

44
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,520
the second largest city in Germany.

45
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,480
In 1833, somewhere around here
in Speckstrasse,

46
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,760
then known as Specksgang, or
Bacon Alley, Johannes was born.

47
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,400
MUSIC: Piano Concerto No. 1 in
D Minor, Op 15, by Johannes Brahms

48
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,000
Johannes' parents were
essentially a respectable
working class couple.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,360
But the area they lived in
was desperately impoverished.

50
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,160
Frankly, a slum.

51
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,600
His father was charming
and good-looking.

52
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,160
He worked as a bugler for the town
militia and as a "bier fiddler" -

53
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,480
a mildly contemptuous term
for someone who plays music in the
streets, and in bars and cafes.

54
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,120
Christiane, his mother, was
17 years older than her husband

55
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,000
and had probably given
up any hope of marriage.

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,920
She was, however, a good
cook and housekeeper,
and an excellent seamstress.

57
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,800
Not particularly prepossessing
to look at, she did have
clear, sparkling, blue eyes.

58
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,520
A characteristic
inherited by her son.

59
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,000
By the time he was 13 years old,
Johannes was already
a pretty accomplished pianist.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,960
It seems he was sent
off to play in the Lokale,

61
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:14,320
bars in the St Pauli district
around here that also served as
cafes, coffee houses, dance halls

62
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,200
and brothels.

63
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,160
Later in life, he would describe
his childhood as a curse.

64
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,760
But he also said
that he didn't regret it.

65
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,000
Perhaps when he played the piano
in the brothels, his fingers moving
automatically,

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,280
he was able to dream,
compose, even read.

67
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,480
He was a prodigious reader.

68
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,600
In other words, the experience
may have strengthened him.

69
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,920
MUSIC: "Three Sacred Choruses"
by Johannes Brahms

70
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,840
Here, at St Michael's Church in
Hamburg,

71
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,920
we can locate the roots
of Brahms's spiritual life.

72
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,960
He was born and brought up
a Lutheran, of course, and

73
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,880
he certainly took seriously Luther's
insistence on the importance of a
close personal study of the Bible.

74
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,600
The Bible was a book that Brahms
knew extremely well and he used
as a resource all his life.

75
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,640
Brahms never made any clear
statement about his beliefs,

76
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,360
but seems to have been
a true agnostic,

77
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,680
doubting some of the fundamental
doctrines of Christianity.

78
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,720
Nothing, it was said, made him
angrier

79
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,600
than when it was assumed he was
a conventional believer because
of his religious compositions.

80
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:37,400
For him, the Bible was a source
of poetry, of morality,
and, perhaps, a source of wisdom.

81
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,480
But not necessarily the word of God.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,560
For the music of Brahms,

83
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,560
Harry and the choir have come to
the Church of St Anne and St Agnes
in the City of London.

84
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,480
It was built by Sir Christopher Wren
after the Great Fire, virtually
destroyed during the Blitz

85
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,400
and rebuilt in the 1960s for the
Lutheran congregation of the city.

86
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,400
MUSIC: "Ein Deutsches Requiem"
Op. 45, Johannes Brahms

87
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,080
It's an appropriate location to
record some excerpts from the key
work of Brahms' early career -

88
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,680
the free-thinking and deeply
humanistic German Requiem.

89
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,560
What's fantastic about
the German Requiem

90
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
is the whole story behind it.

91
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,200
His whole personality behind it.

92
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,560
The choice of texts which, for
me, is the most inspiring thing.

93
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,280
They are so personal to him
and his beliefs.

94
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Ladies and gents,
can we have you please?

95
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,920
Brahms, of course, sets his texts
in German,

96
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,760
but because we've decided
to perform some of the extracts
in English translation,

97
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,560
you might lose some of Brahms'
perfect setting
of the German syllables.

98
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,200
But I do think you gain that
immediacy of understanding.

99
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:58,840
# Blessed they

100
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,840
# Blessed

101
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:19,560
# Blessed are they that mourn

102
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:28,720
# For they shall have comfort

103
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:36,240
# They shall have comfort. #

104
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,800
# Blessed... #

105
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,000
'As part of his research for this
performance of the German Requiem,

106
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,400
'Harry has joined me in Hamburg
for a visit to the Brahms Museum

107
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,320
'and to meet its director,
Joachim Kossmann.'

108
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,760
Hello. Nice to meet you.

109
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,360
Hello. Lovely to meet you.

110
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,800
Welcome
to the Johannes Brahms Museum.

111
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,520
It's not just writing a requiem.
It's taking the sections from the
Bible, which he knew so, so well,

112
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,640
and making something that is very
personal, making his own statement.

113
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,600
And that's what gives the piece
its eternal musical life.

114
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,320
This is a very, very important
document

115
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,360
because this is the handwriting
of eight-year-old Brahms.

116
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,680
That's beautiful.
Isn't it beautiful?

117
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,840
It is a letter to his teacher
saying, "I'm sorry,

118
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:55,320
"I haven't practised enough
last year but I will practise more
next year."

119
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,560
Because the teacher, Otto Cossel,
was always very critical
about his compositions.

120
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,240
He wanted him to practise piano.

121
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,480
This teacher saw him
becoming a piano virtuoso.

122
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,600
But Brahms had other ideas.

123
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,120
The Requiem is a substantial work,
over an hour long

124
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,160
normally performed with a
huge orchestra and chorus.

125
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,640
Harry has chosen to perform it
in this much less known
four-handed piano version.

126
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,840
This was Brahms' own arrangement
at the request of his publisher.

127
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,160
His publisher thought, in order
to get the work better known,
not only throughout Europe

128
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,840
but also into England, let's make
an arrangement for a piano duet.

129
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,120
We've actually got a Bosendorfer
piano of the same period,

130
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,280
so there's a particular
quality to this Bosendorfer.

131
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,720
It has a thundering bass
and a really eerie top register.

132
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,400
Of course, you lose the colours
of the orchestra.

133
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,440
But what you do benefit from
is that you get the vocal colours

134
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,960
which can get so lost
in a big orchestral version.

135
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,520
# Das Gras ist verdorret

136
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:43,560
# Und die Blume abgefallen... #

137
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,920
The picture of Brahms that I grew up
with is of an old man with a huge
beard, a huge white beard.

138
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,800
Stout, twinkly but perhaps
a little bit aggressive.

139
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,640
This picture is Brahms in his 30s,
around the time when he wrote
the German Requiem.

140
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,480
He's actually quite a slight
young man.

141
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,320
Although his face is getting
a little bit round.

142
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,800
Very handsome.
Those famous piercing blue eyes.

143
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,760
Above all, this picture,
to me, is a picture of
determination and of confidence.

144
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,000
Look at that tight-set mouth.

145
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,120
I suspect that Brahms never
doubted his own gifts.

146
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,400
I think Brahms knew
that he would make it,

147
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,640
that he had something
important to say.

148
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,000
In the spring of 1868,
the young, unknown composer

149
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,400
had a version of his Requiem
ready for performance. And by his
own admission,

150
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
feeling wretched with nerves,

151
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:49,320
he made the journey
to the cathedral city of Bremen,
100 kilometres west of Hamburg.

152
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,440
Brahms' worries weren't about
technical matters like
under-rehearsal.

153
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,280
I suspect his anxiety had
deeper roots.

154
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,200
The Requiem wasn't written on
commission. It was something Brahms
felt compelled to write

155
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,120
and it is patently a deeply felt
statement of his faith,
whatever that might be.

156
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,000
It was also
potentially controversial.

157
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,560
A requiem performed
in a great cathedral on Good Friday

158
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,800
and absolutely no mention of Christ.

159
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:33,560
# Ich hoffe auf dich

160
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,560
Ich hoffe auf dich

161
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,360
# Auf dich

162
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,320
# Ich hoffe auf dich

163
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,680
# Ich hoffe auf dich

164
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,920
# Der Gerechten Seelen sind
in Gottes Hand... #

165
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,320
150 years after the event,
it's not difficult to imagine
why Brahms chose

166
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,440
to unveil his masterpiece
at the Easter concert in this
beautiful, impressive cathedral.

167
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,880
# ..Der Gerechten Seelen sind
in Gottes Hand

168
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,760
# Und keine Qual ruhret sie an... #

169
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:21,000
The work is carefully titled
Ein Deutsches Requiem -
A German Requiem.

170
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,880
German in this case referring to
the language sung rather than to
the composer's fellow countrymen.

171
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,080
Brahms said he almost called it
A Human Requiem.

172
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,720
As to Brahms' faith, well,
around the time of the first
performanceof the Requiem,

173
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,240
he wrote his conductor, Rheintaler,
a letter.

174
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:54,240
In it he said, "I could dispense
with passages like St John, 3.16."

175
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,560
The passage he could dispense with
goes like this.

176
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,160
"God so loved the world that he gave
his only begotten son

177
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:07,000
"that whoever believes in him
should not perish
but have everlasting life."

178
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,880
Brahms couldn't have made
himself clearer than that.

179
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:17,280
# How lovely is thy dwelling place

180
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,760
# O lord of Hosts

181
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,080
# O lord of Hosts

182
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,040
# Thy dwelling place

183
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:44,800
# O lord of Hosts... #

184
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,640
Brahms got away with it.

185
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,760
His music was interspersed with
pieces by other composers - Tartini,
Bach, Schumann.

186
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,120
Rheintaler cleverly suggested that
they should also perform Handel's
great aria from the Messiah,

187
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,280
I Know That My Redeemer Liveth.

188
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,600
Brahms didn't object and so Christ
did get a mention after all.

189
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:12,960
# ..How lovely is thy dwelling place

190
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,840
# O lord of Hosts... #

191
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,040
Over 2,000 people came to listen,
including friends and other
influential musicians.

192
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,880
Brahms, still in his thirties,
had finally arrived.

193
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,640
# ..Yea, fainteth, it longeth,
yea, fainteth, it longeth

194
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:43,160
# Yea, fainteth, yea, fainteth,
yea, fainteth

195
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:51,880
# For the courts of the Lord... #

196
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,680
The original idea for the Requiem
must have been closely bound up
with the death of his mother.

197
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,240
The first mention of the peace
is in a letter

198
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,640
written only a few months
after she died,
so she must have been on his mind.

199
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,280
And in the sublime 5th movement,
which was held back from the
performancehere in Bremen,

200
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,040
we find a promise
of maternal comfort.

201
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,960
"Now is your time of sorrow
but I will see you again."

202
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,640
# Ihr habt nun

203
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:36,880
# Traurigkeit... #

204
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,600
The movement is a
bit of a stand-alone movement.

205
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,320
It's a totally different
atmosphere from the other pieces.

206
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,600
It's very...comforting. I think
that's the main word. Reassuring.

207
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:54,480
And I was told by a wonderful singing
teacher who said you have to imagine
yourself as an angel,

208
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,080
or possibly once you've had children,
you imagine yourself as a mother

209
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,120
and that's certainly the way I think
about it

210
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,760
when I'm singing this reassuring,
comforting presence

211
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,560
that's going to heal all the wounds
and badness in people's
struggle through life.

212
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,400
# ..Ich will euch wieder sehen

213
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:21,040
# Und euer Herz soll sich freuen,
freuen

214
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:35,320
# Und eure Freude soll niemand
von euch nehmen... #

215
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,720
A requiem mass for the dead, missa
pro defunctis,

216
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,000
is normally composed for
the performance at funerals
or memorial services.

217
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,720
The word Requiem comes
from the first line of
the standard Latin text.

218
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,240
"Requiem eternam dona eis, Domine."

219
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,240
Grant them eternal rest, O Lord.

220
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,280
Brahms produced something different.

221
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,160
A concert requiem, or with his
piano version, even a domestic one.

222
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:11,080
# ..Ich will euch wieder sehen... #

223
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:17,160
Brahms was only 33,
but death had already cast
its shadow onto his soul.

224
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,280
To uncover what I think is the
earliest and deepest layer of
inspiration for the German Requiem,

225
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,880
we have to turn the clock back
15 years.

226
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,520
Whilst celebrating his 20th birthday
hiking down the Rhine,

227
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,640
Brahms passed through Dusseldorf
and there he had an encounter
that would change his life.

228
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,920
Imagine the young Johannes, who was
on holiday, deciding on the spur of
the moment

229
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,760
to come here to this house
to call on one of his heroes,

230
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,280
the composer Robert Schumann
and his wife Clara, the formidable
piano virtuoso.

231
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,480
He'd never met them before so he
must have been extremely nervous.
He knocked on the door.

232
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,080
And they were both out. However, he
came back the next day, tried again.

233
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,320
And Robert Schumann
answered the door.

234
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,480
This is the first floor
of the house

235
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,400
so it could very well have been
the place where the piano was and
where music was played.

236
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,400
So we can imagine Brahms coming
here, his heart in his mouth,

237
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,640
to meet the great composer
and his formidable wife.

238
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,080
So Brahms sat down and played

239
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,800
one of his own piano pieces.

240
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,000
At the end of the session,

241
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,520
Robert Schumann turned round and
said to the young man, "You and
I understand each other."

242
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,600
The Schumanns were German music's
most celebrated couple.

243
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,800
Always on the lookout for emerging
talent,

244
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:42,160
they now publicly proclaimed
the unknown composer, scarcely
out of his teens, as a genius.

245
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,360
Brahms, Robert declared,
was the chosen one,

246
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,840
whilst Clara wrote that he had
come as if sent directly from God.

247
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,200
This must have had a huge impact
on Brahms's self confidence

248
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,600
but their friendship was to be
cruelly cut short after only a year,

249
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,160
when Robert Schumann was afflicted
with mental illness.

250
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,960
It was a descent into hell.

251
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,720
He was seized by violent attacks
of hallucinations

252
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:20,240
and, with tragic irony, he was
tortured by strange, unearthly music
and nightmarish mocking voices.

253
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,560
Finally he could stand it no longer.

254
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:34,280
One night he ran from his house in
his dressing gown, came to a bridge,
and threw himself into the Rhine.

255
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,240
He didn't kill himself. He was
dragged from the river by some
fishermen

256
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,160
and asked to be taken to an asylum.

257
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,440
Two and a half years later,
the great Romantic composer
Robert Schumann was dead.

258
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,760
His wife Clara and his
young protege, Brahms,
were stricken with grief.

259
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,480
A decade on, Brahms still felt it
as an enduring and agonising loss.

260
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,560
In the 6th movement of the German
Requiem, there's an anger that was
boiling up in him.

261
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,880
Brahms really was crying out to God,

262
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:21,640
"Why have you taken
Schumann away from us, away from
me and the musical world?"

263
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,880
Brahms just erupts. It's really
incredibly exciting music.

264
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:34,040
# Der Tod ist verschlungen
in den Sieg

265
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,320
# Der Tod ist verschlungen

266
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,200
# In den Sieg

267
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,920
# In den Sieg

268
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,600
# In den Sieg

269
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,920
# Ist verschlungen,
verschlungen in den Sieg

270
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,640
# Tod, wo ist dein Stachel?

271
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,600
# Tod, Tod, wo ist dein Stachel?

272
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:10,040
# Holle, wo ist dein Sieg?

273
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,480
# Holle, wo ist dein Sieg?

274
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:21,040
# Holle, wo ist dein Sieg?

275
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,640
# Holle, wo ist dein Sieg?

276
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,320
# Tod

277
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,840
# Wo ist dein Stachel?

278
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,200
# Holle

279
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,920
# Holle, wo ist dein Sieg?

280
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,320
# Wo

281
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,480
# Wo

282
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,680
# Wo

283
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:57,760
# Wo ist dein Sieg?

284
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:03,480
Harry, there are so many
interior contemplative moments
in the Requiem.

285
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,440
This is not one of them, is it?

286
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,320
This is hugely, obviously dramatic.

287
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,120
Dramatic, almost angry at times. Yes.

288
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,480
I mean, I feel it suddenly
gets the choir to sing this amazing
legato, rich harmonies going around.

289
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,240
It's almost the opera
he didn't write, it seems.

290
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,360
The choir are now singing at
absolute at full pelt, aren't they?

291
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,880
Yes.

292
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:32,640
# Holle, wo ist dein Sieg?

293
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,400
# Holle, wo ist dein Sieg? #

294
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,040
They're crashing away. Amazing.
Fabulous, absolutely fabulous.

295
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,040
It's a marvellous bit to sing,
isn't it? This release... It expands.
..you can be expansive.

296
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,840
It's hope, isn't it?
It's a positive device,
isn't it, that lovely ascension?

297
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,480
The whole Requiem is a requiem
of hope.

298
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,720
Out of his personal experiences
and emotions,

299
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,800
his very human anger and grief,
Brahms had produced a masterpiece.

300
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:11,360
Beautiful choral music with
sincere sentiments that resonated
with audiences and performers

301
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,600
no matter what their faith
or religious beliefs.

302
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,280
After playing through the
four-handed piano arrangement,

303
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,040
Clara Schumann wrote
to the composer,

304
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:35,040
"This is a truly tremendous work of
art and it moves the entire being
like nothing else before it."

305
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,040
Within five years, the work
had been sung across Germany

306
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,040
and had had performances in Vienna,
Paris and London.

307
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:54,440
# Blessed, blessed, blessed

308
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:02,440
# Blessed are the dead

309
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,680
# The dead... #

310
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,040
Brahms's Requiem is one of the most
challenging pieces to sing.

311
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,160
I think you need immense stamina
to get through it.

312
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,880
Not just vocally, but emotionally.

313
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,520
The singers have to find the depth
within themselves and the strength

314
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,840
to cover all the places
Brahms wanted to take you.

315
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,120
When you have a whole performance of
it in one go, I think the audience
is very often shocked

316
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,160
to feel the immensity of emotion.

317
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:36,640
# From henceforth... #

318
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,400
It's a remarkable achievement.

319
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,840
The Requiem made Brahms'
name and reputation.

320
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,480
And though still a young man,
he now settled into his role
as a major composer.

321
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,760
He moved to Vienna,
the European capital of music.

322
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,040
And while there, he created some
of the 19th century's greatest and
most deeply felt symphonic music.

323
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:13,000
And it was the symphony
that drew our second composer,
Anton Bruckner, to Vienna as well.

324
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,920
Despite some similarities,
these were two men from very
different spiritual backgrounds.

325
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,560
In contrast to Brahms' upbringing
within the Protestant tradition,

326
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,280
Anton Bruckner was
a devout Roman Catholic.

327
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,240
To explore some of his magnificent
sacred music,

328
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,400
Harry Christopher's choir,
The Sixteen, have chosen to visit
Dowey Abbey,

329
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,320
a monastery in Berkshire.

330
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,720
Here, the abbey church
possesses both the appropriate
devotional atmosphere

331
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,320
and a generous acoustic that allows
Bruckner's unique voice to be heard.

332
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:55,920
# ..Dona eis, Domine

333
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:19,920
# Et lux perpetua luceat eis... #

334
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,840
This is Anton Bruckner photographed
shortly before his death in 1896,

335
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,440
when, after a lifetime of obscurity
and failure,

336
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,680
he'd finally been recognised as one
of the great composers of his age.

337
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,400
During his years of struggle, it
was the Church

338
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:44,360
and the composition of church music
that he turns to time and time again
for consolation.

339
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:52,560
# In die illa

340
00:29:52,560 --> 00:30:02,040
# Illa tremenda

341
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:15,400
# Quando coeli movendi... #

342
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:20,360
The first of 11 children,
Anton was born in Ansfelden,

343
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,520
a village hidden away in a
forgotten part of upper Austria.

344
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,480
The community was conservative,
even reactionary,

345
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,040
untroubled by any new ideas being
hatched in the big world outside.

346
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,040
For a child born here, expectations
cannot have been very great.

347
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:43,040
# ..Judicare saeculum

348
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:49,120
# Per ignem.... #

349
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,680
Like so many Austrians of the time,
the Bruckners were pious people.

350
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,760
The most important legacy
of Anton's upbringing
was his unshakeable faith.

351
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,520
Even when, in later life, he may
have had doubts about his music,

352
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,920
he never lost trust in his God
and the Roman Catholic Church.

353
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,480
Anton's father died when
he was only 12 years old.

354
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,440
On the very same day,
his mother brought him here, to
the great monastery of St Florian.

355
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,680
And begged the prior
to take him on as a chorister.

356
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,120
This was an act
not so much of callousness,
as of rigorous good sense.

357
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,640
Despite his age -
Anton was a little too old -
the Prior agreed to take him on.

358
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,880
His mother was not to know
that she'd introduced her son

359
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,280
to the place that was to be,
for the rest of his life,
his spiritual home.

360
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,640
In this beautiful and ancient
establishment of work and prayer,

361
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,240
Bruckner was protected from the
outside world.
First, as a boy chorister,

362
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,880
then, in his twenties,
as the church organist.

363
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,240
He felt he had a calling
to serve God

364
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,840
as a musician
and as a composer of sacred music.

365
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,840
There it is, the organ
that Bruckner played while he
was at the monastery.

366
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,200
It's rather impressive.

367
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,520
Klaus, thank you very much for that.

368
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,120
So, you were playing Bruckner's
organ.

369
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,440
Yes, this is the organ

370
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,720
which inspired Bruckner
for his work, his composing.

371
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,040
It's not the original console.

372
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,880
You can see it's a modern piece
installed in 1951.

373
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,480
But the rest of the organ, the
pipes, would have been what he knew?
Yes. That's right.

374
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,640
The case is original,
with more than 7,300 pipes.

375
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,200
That's a big, big organ.

376
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,360
And his duties would be to play
at every service?

377
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,160
I think he played a lot of services.

378
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,320
He used to, we know, improvise.

379
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,360
Improvising was the speciality
of Anton Bruckner.

380
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:52,880
We know he did compose few pieces
for the organ because he was a big
improviser.

381
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,120
And a very good improviser.

382
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,400
MUSIC: "Missa Brevis" Sanctus
by Palestrina

383
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:02,320
# Sanctus, sanctus

384
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,520
# Sanctus... #

385
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,440
In this self-contained world,
the music-making that accompanied
every ritual and service

386
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,800
was traditional and conservative.

387
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:24,480
For the budding composer Bruckner,
this was a technical education

388
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,280
in Catholic church music at its
most refined, pure and profound.

389
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,840
# Sanctus... #

390
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:41,280
HARRY CHRISTOPHERS: We know
he loved the music of Palestrina
and other Renaissance composers.

391
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,960
Looked to the way that music
was built, and built on it.

392
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,800
Enlarged it into a whole
succession of masses

393
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,760
which tend to get bigger and bigger.

394
00:34:52,400 --> 00:35:19,560
# Sanctus, sanctus

395
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:44,480
# Sanctus, sanctus... #

396
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,880
Hello. Hello.

397
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,040
Nice to meet you. It's a pleasure.

398
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,160
This is absolutely beautiful.

399
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,640
Friedrich,
you're one of the librarians in this
extraordinarily beautiful library.

400
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,480
I should put gloves on, shouldn't I?
Yes.

401
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,160
This book is...

402
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,880
This is a copy
of the Missa Solemnis,

403
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,000
composed by Anton Bruckner
here in the monastery.

404
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,080
My reading of German is
non-existent. So that says...

405
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,440
"Missa Solemnis in B.

406
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:43,080
"Zur hochfeierlichen Infulierung
des hochwurdigsten Herrn Pralaten
Friedrich I."

407
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,880
The Provost was elected in 1854,

408
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,200
and for the feast, Anton Bruckner
composed this Missa Solemnis.

409
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,880
So, this was printed in...

410
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,320
It is handwritten by himself.

411
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,720
By Anton Bruckner.
So, this is by Bruckner?

412
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,240
Yes.

413
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,840
Can I open it further?

414
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,320
Let's see what his script is like.

415
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,000
Oh, wow.

416
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,200
MUSIC: "Missa Solemnis"
by Anton Bruckner

417
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,240
Oh, the labour of
love over all of this.

418
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,360
Just fantastically neat.

419
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,920
This almost obsessive neatness
gave me an insight
into the dogged dedication

420
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,440
that Bruckner brought his calling
as a composer in the service of God.

421
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,040
He'd only just turned 30
and the writing of this solemn Mass

422
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,680
proved to be a turning
point in his development.

423
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:50,320
It was the last composition he dared
to commit to paper for five years.

424
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,360
Perhaps, realising
he still had much to learn

425
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,560
and that he needed to grow as a
musician, he decided to move on.

426
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,520
When he was offered the post of
organist here at Linz Cathedral,

427
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,440
he was told he looked a little
shabby and might have to
tidy himself up a bit.

428
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,920
His playing was magnificent and, of
course, he was offered the job.

429
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,360
Bruckner hesitated.

430
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,960
He managed to persuade
the monastery to keep his old job
open for two years

431
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,400
and only when he had
that reassurance
would he take up his new post.

432
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,320
Now that he was a fully fledged
professional musician,
the hard work could begin.

433
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,760
Over the next five years,
instead of composing,
he decided to take lessons -

434
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:48,320
a correspondence course with a
Viennese teacher, Simon Sechter,
in harmony and counterpoint.

435
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,520
In fact, he worked so hard that
his teacher was impelled to write
him a letter which said,

436
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,000
"I do implore you to take care of
yourself and allow yourself
sufficient relaxation."

437
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,200
# Locus iste

438
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:11,240
# A Deo factus est... #

439
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:16,400
If anything,
Bruckner's love for the church was
becoming even more intense.

440
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,640
This motet, written for the
dedication of a chapel in Linz,

441
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,560
seems to translate this love
directly into music.

442
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:32,400
Locus iste a Deo factus est,
inaestimabile sacramentum
irreprehensibilis est.

443
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,880
This dwelling is God's handiwork,
a mystery beyond price
that cannot be spoken against.

444
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:47,720
# Inaestimabile sacramentum

445
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:59,040
# Inaestimabile sacramentum... #

446
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,280
His Catholicism speaks through maybe
in the simplicity of what he does

447
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,160
but also in the waves of
sounds and emotion.

448
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,000
Even something as simple as Locus
Iste, starts so quietly, so gently

449
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,560
but it goes through
this massive sound in the middle.

450
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,760
It really feels like opening a
door into his religious landscape.

451
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:30,960
# Irreprehensibilis est... #

452
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,600
After 10 years in Linz,
Bruckner, aged 42,

453
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,360
suffered a severe nervous breakdown
and was sent to a sanatorium.

454
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:44,880
# ..A Deo factus est... #

455
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,720
He described it as a condition of
utter degradation and loneliness.

456
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,360
It drove him to the edge of suicide.

457
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,080
Although he recovered, this time,

458
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:00,640
it left a legacy of anxiety
and fear and he decided
he had to leave Linz.

459
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,280
For the rest of his long life,
he earned his living as a teacher
of music while struggling

460
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:17,200
to build his reputation as a
symphonic composer in the capital
of the Austrian Empire, Vienna.

461
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,240
The apartment that was Bruckner's
home for nigh on two decades is now
a suite in the Hotel de France.

462
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,600
Guten Abend.

463
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,200
By the 1870s, both Brahms and
Bruckner had made their homes
here in the Austrian capital.

464
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:41,240
Brahms, now a musical celebrity
thanks to the German Requiem,
was in his mid-30.

465
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,160
Bruckner, around 10 years older,
was still working in semi-obscurity.

466
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,800
So, I'll be sleeping tonight
in Anton Bruckner's room.

467
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,520
It feels slightly odd, when we've
lost so much of the physical world
that these two composers knew,

468
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,200
to be here,
somewhere quite so intimate.

469
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,320
I don't expect to
see any ghosts but...

470
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,520
I do expect a good night's sleep.

471
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,920
MUSIC: Symphony No. 4, 3rd movement
by Bruckner

472
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,080
For both composers,
Vienna was the ultimate test.

473
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:32,000
It could lay claim to be the
European capital of music,
indeed of the arts.

474
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,560
And any German-speaking composer
must have dreamt of making it here.

475
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,680
Brahms rented two rooms
here in Karlsgasse.

476
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,760
A friend described them as a sort
of place suitable for a student,

477
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,360
a minor civil servant,
or a salesman starting out in trade.

478
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,680
They were, frankly, shabby.

479
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,960
And in Viennese eyes, at least,
not remotely appropriate
for a great artist.

480
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,840
But then, that was typical
of the man. He was a bundle
of contradictions -

481
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,840
mean-spirited, yet tender.

482
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,080
Progressive, reactionary.

483
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:10,520
He once boasted that he could find
any passage in his Bible instantly,
even in the dark.

484
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,240
Like Bruckner,
he was still writing sacred music.

485
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:25,040
Above all, he was drawn to the bleak
agony and the harsh questions
of the Book of Job.

486
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,640
# Warum

487
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,280
# Warum ist das Licht... #

488
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,360
"Wherefore is light given to him
that is in misery,

489
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:49,040
"and life unto the bitter in soul,
which long for death
but it cometh not?

490
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,200
"Why is light given
to a man whose way is hid

491
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,400
"and whom God hath hedged in?"

492
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,680
If A German Requiem had
promised comfort

493
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,200
to the living in the presence of
death,

494
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,360
then this motet, with its cry of
despair and subsequent sense of
stoic resignation,

495
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:30,040
offers another
individual response to the deaths
that had clouded Brahms' life.

496
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,960
It was inevitable
that Brahms and Bruckner would meet.

497
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,920
But surprisingly, it was neither
in the concert hall, nor the church.

498
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:55,040
Our two composers had a taste
for cold draught Pilsner.

499
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:01,880
And the best beer in Vienna could
be found at an eating house called
Zum Roten Igel, the Red Hedgehog.

500
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,160
The place range with
the sounds of fierce arguments

501
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,040
between various cliques
proselytising for their
chosen musical champions.

502
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:16,960
Accounts of the two masters
meeting bristled with discomfort
and suppressed aggression.

503
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:24,200
Brahms privately thought Bruckner
a deluded fool, ruined by priests,
his music was a swindle.

504
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:30,320
Bruckner, meanwhile,
dismissed Brahms as a craftsman,
not a composer.

505
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:36,400
Danke schon. In the best description
we have of one of their encounters,
Brahms is cold and dismissive,

506
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:44,160
whilst Bruckner, always polite,
sometimes even obsequious, scuttles
off to get his great rival a beer.

507
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,960
Nice and cold.

508
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,360
# Ecce sacerdos magnus

509
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:00,760
# Ecce sacerdos magnus

510
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,360
# Ecce sacerdos

511
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:14,640
# Magnus. #

512
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,160
This is Bruckner's rather
bird-like face with, in this case,
quite a beady stare.

513
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,680
He never sported a beard,
unlike more fashionable men
of his time,

514
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,640
and he was mocked by
the sophisticated Viennese
for his odd behaviour.

515
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,560
And is there an indication
here too, in his expression,

516
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,440
of the insecurities he often
felt about the wider world
beyond the safety of the Church?

517
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,280
Bruckner's writing is so of him

518
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,240
and his beliefs.

519
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,840
You see that same
fervour and personality

520
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,400
and love of his church
coming through.

521
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:03,960
His sheer power, emotion,
is so profound.

522
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,200
He has put so much of his own
personality into the music.

523
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,960
VOICES GRADUALLY RISE
IN A LOUD CRESCENDO

524
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,000
It's loud, isn't it?
It is very loud.

525
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,920
It's the impact,
the cumulative impact. Fantastic.

526
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,840
Can you tell me how Bruckner
achieves his effects in this?

527
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,680
In this particular piece,
he uses a sort of refrain, really,
he uses it three times in all.

528
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,840
And he builds it up from a succession
of root position chords. The simplest
chords you can get. Absolutely, yes.

529
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:46,880
He starts in E major, then goes
to A minor, right through, G major,
E flat, ending up in C major.

530
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,600
He goes right through
the progression. We're going to sing
that progression of chords.

531
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:58,160
THEY SING THROUGH
THE CHORD PROGRESSION

532
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,200
That's fantastic, and they don't
quite go where you'd expect them to.

533
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,880
There are a couple
of surprises in there.

534
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,200
And at the beginning, he just has the
sopranos and altos with the organ,
and the men are with the trombones,

535
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,160
until we get to this fantastic
F major, C major finish.

536
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,720
Everything comes together,
it's quite brilliant. Let's hear it.

537
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:36,760
THEY SING, REPEATING
THE SECTION IN FULL

538
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,400
The power and originality
of Bruckner's sacred music
proved to be no barrier

539
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,400
to its ready acceptance as music
for worship in the Catholic Church.

540
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,520
But for his secular orchestral
music, it was a different story.

541
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:37,120
The musical establishment's
response to his earliest symphonies
was criticism and indifference.

542
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,880
Then, after 20 years of
misunderstanding, his 7th Symphony,

543
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:52,920
as vast and ambitious as a
cathedral, found an audience.

544
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:03,120
But the recognition Anton Bruckner
craved had come almost too late.

545
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,640
As he grew older,
he was unable to hide his
increasingly obsessive behaviour.

546
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:12,640
What started out simply
as counting bars in music,
erupted into numeromania.

547
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:18,800
He would count everything,
grains of sand, stars in the sky,
leaves on a tree, even the pearls

548
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:24,480
set on to ladies' dresses,
rigorously returning to his starting
point when he lost his tally.

549
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,480
And his prayers, always strictly
observed, became ever more feverish.

550
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:42,520
For Bruckner, every experience was
intense and absolute, and every act
of composition was an act of prayer.

551
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,880
In the Roman Catholic faith, the
Virgin Mary is a bringer of comfort.

552
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:54,320
And in his profound devotion to her,
Bruckner set the text, Ave Maria,
three times.

553
00:50:54,320 --> 00:51:03,240
# Benedicta tu in mulieribus

554
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:09,640
# Et benedictus

555
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:18,600
# Fructus ventris tui. #

556
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:24,120
In his final year,
Bruckner, now frail and with
a mind wandering alarmingly,

557
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:28,360
was offered a place to
live by the Emperor himself,
here at the Belvedere Palace.

558
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:33,600
He must have felt extremely proud
that a man from a small village
in Upper Austria

559
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,120
had been deemed worthy
of such an honour.

560
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:43,440
# Jesus...! #

561
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,320
His last day start unexceptionally.

562
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,800
He worked in the morning on
the finale of his 9th Symphony,

563
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,480
then in the early afternoon, he went
for a stroll in the public gardens.

564
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,080
He then returned to his small
apartment where he died.

565
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:14,760
The funeral of Anton Bruckner
took place on 4th October 1896

566
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,520
in Vienna's most beautiful church,
the Karlskirche.

567
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,680
The church was packed.

568
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,320
When Brahms came
to pay his respects,

569
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:30,560
an attendant assured him that, yes,
they could probably squeeze him in.

570
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,720
But he hesitated,
and then turned to leave.

571
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:40,120
He was heard to mutter,
"Never mind, soon my coffin."

572
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,760
Bruchner's body was brought home
to the monastery of St Florian,

573
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:15,400
and laid to rest directly underneath
the great organ on which he had
learned to play and to compose.

574
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,040
Once, when he was asked what
he might say to his God

575
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,000
if required to give an account
of his life here on Earth,

576
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,120
Bruckner allegedly replied,
"I will present to him the score
of some of my work,

577
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,880
"and he will judge me mercifully."

578
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:54,320
# Amen. #

579
00:53:54,320 --> 00:54:01,000
Johannes Brahms was only
63 when Bruckner died,
but his life too was nearly over.

580
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,960
If Bruckner was assured
of the immortality of his soul,

581
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:13,040
then Brahms was assured
of this - that his immortality
lay in his work.

582
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,520
# Mit Fried und Freud

583
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:23,120
# Ich fahr dahin

584
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,280
# In Gottes

585
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:32,400
# Willen

586
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,560
# Getrost ist mir

587
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:41,640
# Mein Herz

588
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,720
# Und Sinn. #

589
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,560
He composed less and less
during those final years,

590
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:54,280
and inevitably friends
that he had cared for and
members of his family died.

591
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,880
He must have been hit terribly
hard in 1896 when he heard of
the death of Clara Schumann.

592
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,360
She had been his greatest friend
ever since that first meeting
in Dusseldorf 40 years earlier.

593
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:15,640
Now, the last link with
Brahms's inspiration and hero,
Robert Schumann, was gone.

594
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:32,360
His last composition was
this set of organ preludes

595
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,360
based on chorales that he must
have heard in church as a child.

596
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,720
There were found at his
apartment after his death.

597
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,920
Perhaps he would never
have published them himself.

598
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:54,320
Simple and sweetly melancholic,
they seem to look back to the
happier days of Brahms's youth.

599
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,320
It's kind of difficult to work out
exactly what he was hoping to achieve
with these chorale preludes,

600
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:07,320
but I think that it was just a sort
of homage to Robert Schumann and
Clara, and it's the sort of thing

601
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,000
that people do in later life,

602
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,880
which is to go back to something
that they feel has been left undone.

603
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,080
That may well have been it.

604
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,600
It took a long time for Brahms
to admit he was ill with cancer.

605
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,360
But, inevitably, the time came
when he had to take to his bed,

606
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:33,320
and finally, on 3rd April 1897,
Johannes Brahms died.

607
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,640
This is where Brahms
was finally laid to rest.

608
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,280
In what he himself
had called a sacred place.

609
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:03,640
Next to his friend Johann Strauss,
and near Schubert and Beethoven.

610
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,360
A great composer amongst his peers.

611
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,520
MUSIC: Requiem, Op. 48,
Johannes Brahms

612
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,200
For Brahms, life was a struggle,
something to be endured.

613
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:41,760
His music doesn't seem to have been
written in praise of God, nor does
he really address him directly.

614
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,280
The nearest he comes to that
is to ask the question, why?

615
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,240
And even then,
he seems uncertain as to whether
God is actually listening.

616
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:55,880
His music provides us, his fellow
human beings, with comfort,
glimpses of a transient beauty,

617
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:03,280
and perhaps the promise after
death of a long sought-for
and well-deserved rest.

618
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:17,800
In the next episode of Sacred Music,
my journey takes me to Paris

619
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:23,880
to discover the exquisitely French
church music of Gabriel Faure
and Francis Poulenc.
